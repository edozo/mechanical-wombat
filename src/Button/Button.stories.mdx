# Button

## Description

This is my button. There are many others like it, but this one is mine. My button is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. Without me, my button is useless. Without my button, I am useless. I must click my button true. I must click straighter than my enemy, who is trying to click me. I must click him before he clicks me. I will. Before Kent I swear this creed: my button and myself are defenders of my app. We are the masters of our browser. We are the saviors of my sanity. So be it, until there is no users, but peace. Amen.
